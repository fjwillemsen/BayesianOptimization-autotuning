# PhD: optimization algorithms for auto-tuning GPU kernels
Encompassing repository for software written or used, as well as data generated or used in the context of Floris-Jan Willemsen's PhD "on optimization algorithms for auto-tuning GPU kernels". 
This is a work in progress, changes made may break compatibility. 

## How to use
1. **Clone** this repository and its **submodules**. This repository contains [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/nl/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to recursively clone submodules as well. If 2FA is enabled, some interactions on clusters may require logging in. In this case, create a [PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to use as a scoped password. 
2. Create a **virtual environment**. You can use the instructions in the [Kernel Tuner documentation](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/contributing.html#development-environment).
