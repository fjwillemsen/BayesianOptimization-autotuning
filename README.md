This is a work in progress, changes made may break compatibility. 

## How to use
1. **Clone** this repository and its **submodules**. This repository contains [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/nl/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to recursively clone submodules as well.  
2. Create a **virtual environment**. You can use the instructions in the [Kernel Tuner documentation](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/contributing.html#development-environment).
