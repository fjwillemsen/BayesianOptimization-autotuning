## How to reproduce results
1. Create a new virtual environment, separate of the other virtual environment of this repo (this work is before the dependencies were unified). 
2. Activate the new virtual environment. 
3. Use `pip install -r venv_requirements.txt` to install the required packages in the virtual environment. When packages are changed (added, deleted, updated), use `pip freeze > venv_requirements.txt` to make these changes accessible. 
4. Move into the `experiments` directory.
5. Running the visualization script is simple, e.g.: `python experiments.py -kernels GEMM convolution pnpoly`. The `-kernels` keyword denotes the list of kernel names to visualize (space-seperated), while the `-devices` keyword denotes a list of GPUs to visualize (space-seperated, by default `GTX_TITAN_X`). Running this script will result in Mathplotlib plots (by default resulting in the plots of figure 1 in the paper) and output in the terminal. 
6. The `experiments.py` script takes care of running each specified algorithm in the simulation mode of Kernel Tuner with the specified options, then aggregates the resulting data in a cache file in the folder `cached_data_used/cached_experiments`. On each run, it first checks whether a cached version is available in this folder, as running each specified algorithm for the specifed number of times (`repeats`) can take a while. Cached versions of the runs used in the paper are supplied in this repository. To recalculate the results, delete the files in `cached_data_used/cached_experiments`, and run step 2 again (this might take a while depending on the options!). 
7. If necessary, edit the code in the `main` body (starting at line 1471) of `experiments.py`. Different types of plots and other options are available here. Additionally, if necessary, change the `self.strategies` variable at line 414 to point to a dictionary of choice containing the strategies to compare. An exhaustive, descripted list of the dictionaries for the strategies comparisons used in the prospective paper is found in the file `experiments_strategies.py`, also in the `experiments` folder.
